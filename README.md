# catena4460-demo1

Aruduino demo sketch for the MCCI Catena&reg; 4460.

This sketch demonstrates Catena 4460 as a LoRaWAN remote sensor.  The device periodically measures temperature, pressure, humidity, light, and atmospheric resistance; the resulting data is transmitted to the cloud as a packed binary message.

When building, please select Catena 4460 as the target board in the Arduino IDE.
